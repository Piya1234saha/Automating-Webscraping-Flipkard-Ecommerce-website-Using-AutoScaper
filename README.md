## Automating-Webscraping-Flipkard-Ecommerce-website-Using-AutoScaper library

The objective of this project is to develop a web scraping tool using the AutoScraper library in Python to efficiently extract product data from the e-commerce platform Flipkart. I focused on gathering comprehensive information about specific products, such as Google Pixel and iPhone models, including their titles, prices, and customer ratings/reviews.
